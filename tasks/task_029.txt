# Task ID: 29
# Title: Update Gemini Integration Configuration (if needed)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review and potentially modify the ai-services.js file to ensure optimal configuration for Gemini API requests, considering aspects like model parameters or specific headers if applicable based on Google's documentation.
# Details:
The task involves updating the Gemini integration in the ai-services.js file to ensure it uses appropriate settings.

1. Locate the Gemini API request configuration in ai-services.js
2. Update any related configuration parameters that might need adjustment for the increased token limit
3. Ensure that token counting and management logic is updated to account for the new 128k token output limit
4. Update any documentation comments in the code to reflect the new capability
5. Consider implementing a configuration option to enable/disable this feature, as it may be a beta feature subject to change
6. Verify that the token management logic correctly handles the increased limit without causing unexpected behavior
7. Ensure backward compatibility with existing code that might assume lower token limits

The implementation should be clean and maintainable, with appropriate error handling for cases where the beta header might not be supported in the future.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify that the beta header is correctly included and that the system properly handles the increased token limit:

1. Unit test: Verify that the API request to Gemini includes appropriate parameters/headers (if any).
2. Integration test: Make an actual API call to Gemini and confirm a successful response
3. Test with a prompt designed to generate a very large response (>20k tokens but <128k tokens) and verify it completes successfully
4. Test the token counting logic with mock responses of various sizes to ensure it correctly handles responses approaching the 128k limit
5. Verify error handling by simulating API errors related to the beta header
6. Test any configuration options for enabling/disabling the feature
7. Performance test: Measure any impact on response time or system resources when handling very large responses
8. Regression test: Ensure existing functionality using Gemini continues to work as expected

Document all test results, including any limitations or edge cases discovered during testing.
